    Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) is a style sheet language that describes how a markup language is actually displayed [1] , mainly used for HTML and XHTML , and can also be used in XML . can It is a standard of W3C , and the degree of freedom in defining layout and style is high.
    The default file name [2] is style.css.
    If the markup language (ex: HTML ) is responsible for the body of the website , CSS is responsible for decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate a website like a completely different website by leaving the HTML structure intact and changing only the CSS file.
    In the case of CSS3 , which is currently under development , a function that can replace images created with graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradients , and transformations has been added. In addition, various animation functions have been added, replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
