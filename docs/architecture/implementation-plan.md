# Implementation Plan

## Project Summary
- Goal: Rebuild `justini0715.github.io` into an Astro static personal developer website with portfolio, blog, project showcase, and 42 series support.
- Target repository: `justini0715/justini0715.github.io`
- Deployment target: GitHub Pages user site (`https://justini0715.github.io/`)
- Domain target: `https://changwpa.kro.kr`

## Current Phase
- Phase: Phase 4 — Polish and Deployment
- Branch: `phase/4-polish-deployment`
- Status: Complete

## Official Phase List
1. Phase 1 — Foundation
2. Phase 2 — Portfolio Structure
3. Phase 3 — Blog System
4. Phase 4 — Polish and Deployment

## Current Phase Scope
- Finalize SEO and metadata basics.
- Tighten deployment docs/checklists and align the Pages workflow with current Astro guidance.
- Keep the site launch-ready on `github.io` while documenting the exact custom-domain cutover steps for `changwpa.kro.kr`.

## Current Phase Non-Scope
- Final custom domain activation in GitHub Pages settings and DNS.
- Publishing phase branches or merge/PR operations that require GitHub auth.
- Any registrar-side or GitHub account action that requires the user to log in manually.

## Architecture Summary
- Astro static output with content collections for blog posts and projects.
- Source-first repository layout replacing generated legacy output while preserving a recovery branch.
- Pages-first deployment workflow that keeps the `github.io` fallback usable before custom-domain cutover.

## Content Strategy Summary
- 42 support: first-class blog taxonomy, reusable 42 post template, and series metadata for assignment-by-assignment publishing.
- project support: structured project entries backed by real repository evidence.
- blog taxonomy: `42`, `project`, `devlog`, `setup`, `retrospective`.

## Deliverables Checklist
- [x] SEO basics finalized (metadata, canonical handling, robots/sitemap sanity)
- [x] 404 page and launch copy polished
- [x] GitHub Pages deploy workflow aligned with current Astro guidance
- [x] Deployment runbook and launch checklist updated with exact commands and DNS steps
- [x] Phase 4 verification completed

## Verification Plan
1. Run local build, preview, and route checks after polish/deployment updates.
2. Verify the built output and preview server serve `/`, `/about`, `/projects`, `/blog`, at least one blog post, and `/404`.
3. Re-run project-wide TypeScript diagnostics and confirm deployment docs/checklists match the implemented workflow.

## Work Log
- Cloned the remote user-site repository into the writable workspace.
- Confirmed the current repo is legacy Hexo-generated output with a minimal README and generated HTML/CSS/JS assets.
- Created `recovery/legacy-site-20260313` and checked out `phase/1-foundation`.
- Seeded the required manual/docs files into the working branch.
- Replaced the generated Hexo output with an Astro v6 static scaffold, base layout, route skeleton, content-collection schema, global styles, and public assets.
- Installed Astro dependencies locally and verified the scaffold with `npm run build`, `npm run check`, output-route inspection, and project-wide TypeScript diagnostics.
- Branched `phase/2-portfolio-structure` from the verified foundation commit.
- Collected the launch-content roster from brownfield sources: featured projects should center on Inception, cub3d, philosopher, and push_swap.
- Added four repository-backed project entries sourced from the current 42 workspace remotes and README material.
- Updated the home, about, and projects pages to reflect a coherent portfolio-first experience with responsive content blocks.
- Branched `phase/3-blog-system` from the verified portfolio commit.
- Prepared the launch-post roster: one migration/devlog, one 42-repository-quality post, and two 42 systems-series entries for push_swap and philosopher.
- Added four launch posts to the blog collection: two technical posts plus two 42 systems-series posts.
- Updated the blog index and post template to show tags, category metadata, and previous/next series navigation.
- Branched `phase/4-polish-deployment` from the verified blog-system commit.
- Identified final-phase tasks: SEO polish, workflow alignment, preview verification, and explicit custom-domain/DNS runbook steps.
- Updated metadata handling for theme color, robots directives, canonical tags, and article pages.
- Aligned the deploy workflow with Astro’s current GitHub Pages action pattern and documented the user-site/no-`base` rule.
- Expanded the README, deployment runbook, and launch checklist with explicit local commands, GitHub Pages setup, and custom-domain cutover steps.

## Verification Results
- `npm install -D astro @astrojs/sitemap @astrojs/check typescript` → dependencies installed successfully.
- `npm run build` → success; built `/`, `/about`, `/projects`, `/blog`, `404`, and `sitemap-index.xml`.
- `npm run check` → success (`tsc --noEmit`).
- `npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json` via LSP diagnostics → 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `npm run build` after portfolio updates → success; featured project content rendered into `/` and `/projects`.
- `grep` checks against `dist/index.html` and `dist/projects/index.html` → confirmed Inception, cub3d, philosopher, and push_swap content is present in built output.
- `npm run build` after blog updates → success; built all four blog post routes plus `/blog`.
- `grep` checks against `dist/blog/index.html` and `dist/blog/42-philosopher/index.html` → confirmed all launch post titles render and the 42 series navigation links philosopher back to push_swap.
- `npm run build` after polish/deployment updates → success; built `/`, `/about`, `/projects`, `/blog`, all four posts, `404`, and `sitemap-index.xml`.
- `npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4321` (outside sandbox with telemetry disabled) → preview server started successfully.
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:4321/{,/about,/projects,/blog,/blog/42-push-swap,/404}` → all routes returned HTML with the expected page-specific metadata and content.

## Known Blockers / User-Action-Required Items
- GitHub push/PR and Pages settings updates will require the user's GitHub auth later.
- Custom domain DNS changes must wait until the end and will require registrar/DNS access.

## Next Phase Preview
- Final step is architect/verifier sign-off plus handoff of the exact GitHub/DNS actions the user still needs to perform.
