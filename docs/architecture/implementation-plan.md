# Implementation Plan

## Project Summary
- Goal: Rebuild `justini0715.github.io` into an Astro static personal developer website with portfolio, blog, project showcase, and 42 series support.
- Target repository: `justini0715/justini0715.github.io`
- Deployment target: GitHub Pages user site (`https://justini0715.github.io/`)
- Domain target: `https://changwpa.kro.kr`

## Current Phase
- Phase: Phase 1 — Foundation
- Branch: `phase/1-foundation`
- Status: Complete

## Official Phase List
1. Phase 1 — Foundation
2. Phase 2 — Portfolio Structure
3. Phase 3 — Blog System
4. Phase 4 — Polish and Deployment

## Current Phase Scope
- Audit the legacy Hexo-generated repository and preserve recovery access before replacement.
- Seed the required repo-local manual/docs files for the rebuilt site.
- Create the Astro static project scaffold, route skeleton, content system foundation, and GitHub Pages deployment baseline.

## Current Phase Non-Scope
- Final visual polish and launch content completeness.
- Final custom domain activation in GitHub Pages settings and DNS.
- Publishing phase branches or merge/PR operations that require GitHub auth.

## Architecture Summary
- Astro static output with content collections for blog posts and projects.
- Source-first repository layout replacing generated legacy output while preserving a recovery branch.
- Pages-first deployment workflow that keeps the `github.io` fallback usable before custom-domain cutover.

## Content Strategy Summary
- 42 support: first-class blog taxonomy, reusable 42 post template, and series metadata for assignment-by-assignment publishing.
- project support: structured project entries backed by real repository evidence.
- blog taxonomy: `42`, `project`, `devlog`, `setup`, `retrospective`.

## Deliverables Checklist
- [x] Recovery branch created before replacement (`recovery/legacy-site-20260313`)
- [x] Repo-local manual/docs files seeded into the site repository
- [x] Astro scaffold, routes, and base content system created
- [x] GitHub Pages workflow skeleton added
- [x] Phase 1 verification completed

## Verification Plan
1. Install dependencies successfully.
2. Run a local Astro build and confirm key routes exist in output.
3. Confirm deployment config/workflow aligns with Astro GitHub Pages guidance.

## Work Log
- Cloned the remote user-site repository into the writable workspace.
- Confirmed the current repo is legacy Hexo-generated output with a minimal README and generated HTML/CSS/JS assets.
- Created `recovery/legacy-site-20260313` and checked out `phase/1-foundation`.
- Seeded the required manual/docs files into the working branch.
- Replaced the generated Hexo output with an Astro v6 static scaffold, base layout, route skeleton, content-collection schema, global styles, and public assets.
- Installed Astro dependencies locally and verified the scaffold with `npm run build`, `npm run check`, output-route inspection, and project-wide TypeScript diagnostics.

## Verification Results
- `npm install -D astro @astrojs/sitemap @astrojs/check typescript` → dependencies installed successfully.
- `npm run build` → success; built `/`, `/about`, `/projects`, `/blog`, `404`, and `sitemap-index.xml`.
- `npm run check` → success (`tsc --noEmit`).
- `npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json` via LSP diagnostics → 0 errors, 0 warnings.

## Known Blockers / User-Action-Required Items
- GitHub push/PR and Pages settings updates will require the user's GitHub auth later.
- Custom domain DNS changes must wait until the end and will require registrar/DNS access.

## Next Phase Preview
- Phase 2 will turn the scaffold into a coherent portfolio experience with home/about/projects pages, navigation, and responsive layout.
